# PDF tools

The Python scripts in this repository help execute some useful operations on PDF files:

1. [extract-images.py](./extract-images.py) takes full path to a PDF file and extracts all the images to a folder
1. [images-to-pdf.py](./images-to-pdf.py) takes all the images in a specific folder, compresses them and generates a new PDF file
